        extrapolates in the frequency domain. The steps are the following: smoothing the input values, 
        differentiating, applying a short-time Fourier-transformation with overlapped (and Hanning-windowed) windows,
         extrapolating and then applying the inverse of these transformations to the extrapolated values.`,

         a mostly profitable trading strategy is viable. In my free time I may put more work into it.`
